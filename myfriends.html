<h2>"Angelo is one of the most important person in my life. I never thought that we'd get along but surprisingly, we did. He never fails to make me smile and he's really fun to be with.  He's always been there for me especially when times are hard. He is the definition of happiness." -Sophia</h2>

<h2>"Having Angelo as a friend is an excellent example of friendship in itself.  Open-
minded, genuine, compassionate, and level-headed, He can always be counted on 
to listen and provide support when needed.  His wonderful sense of humor, 
adventure, and life experiences have given his the ability to see any situation in a 
positive sense.  Personally believing that ‘people come into our lives for a reason, a 
season, or a lifetime’, I’ve known for a long time that Angelo is a lifetime friend." -Zoren</h2>

<h2>"I've been friends with Angelo for quite a few years and I've come to know what a
valuable friend he is.  He's a good listener with all the qualities you'd want in a 
friend.  Angelo has a good sense of humor and whenever we get together we have 
a great time with lots of laughter." -Ron</h2>
