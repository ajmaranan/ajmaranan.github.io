<h2>"My only son, Angelo is a jolly and cool person and plays as the family's clown & 'ice-breaker'. Very accommodating to his cousins, friends, and peers and willing to make sacrifice for himself at times. Like a typical millenial teenager, he's keen to latest technology and fashion but willing to be reminded of his priorities." -Mom</h2>
